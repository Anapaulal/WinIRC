## v1.2.11

Minor release time! Nothing too big, just a couple of added  features. The specific changes are as follows:

 - There's new buttons on the channel list for closing channels, and an easy way to join channels. 
 - There's also an option to hide or show the status bar on windows phone
 - I've also implemented an early form of /msg 

On background irc - this is planned for a future update. There's some promising new APIs coming in the anniversary update, which look like they'll allow me to easily put the app in the background.
